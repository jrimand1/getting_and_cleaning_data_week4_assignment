# getting_and_cleaning_data_week4_assignment

This repository contains the necessary files for the week 4 programming assignment for coursera, including:
  - the final dataset: "dataset_mean.txt"
  - The R script used to achieve the dataset: "run_analysis.R"
  - the codebook for the dataset: "codebook.md"
  - the README.md file explaining an overview of the project
  
 # dataset_mean.txt
 
 This dataset contains variables from data X that are measurements from sensor signals measured with a Samsung smartphone mounted at at the waist from 30 subjects. The dataset also includes variables from data Y that indicate the type of activity that the subjects performed during recording. Each row is an average of each activity type for each subject. Data is included only on the mean and standard deviation for each activity for each subject.
 
 # run_analysis.R
 
 This R script contains the code used to read the data; label it; combine it into one dataset; extract the variables on mean and standard deviation; and export the dataset.
